        <p class = "testo2">What we suggest you make at home is the classic recipe based on bacon, pecorino cheese and egg yolk. The bacon will be saut√©ed in a large pan with the oil until it becomes transparent but not too crunchy; in a saucepan with plenty of salted water, cook the spaghetti al dente; whisk the grated cheese, egg yolks and pepper in a bowl with quick movements.<br>As soon as the pasta is cooked, it must be drained immediately, put in the pan, mixed quickly and poured into a bowl with the eggs. At this point, immediately after pouring the spaghetti, we will mix everything to form a creamy sauce.<br>01<br>To make pasta carbonara you must first of all take a bowl. Add the egg yolks, the pecorino cheese and a generous pinch of freshly ground pepper. Whisk the mixture well.<br>02<br>When the operation is complete, boil the spaghetti in slightly salted water until al dente. In the meantime, take a frying pan and lightly fry the Pancetta Galbapancetta previously cut into julienne strips in a little extra virgin olive oil.<br>03<br>When cooked, drain the spaghetti, retaining a little of the cooking water ( the pasta should not be too dry). At this point, pour them into the bacon pan, remove them from the heat and mix them together.<br>04<br>Finally, add the beaten eggs and stir everything together vigorously. Serve your pasta carbonara immediately.</p>
